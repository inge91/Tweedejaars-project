NAOqi on the robot
==================

.. _naoqi-def:

What is NAOqi
-------------

**NAOqi** is the name of the main software that runs on the robot and controls
it.

* It runs on the robot, under :ref:`OpenNAO<opennao>` distribution.

* It can also run on your computer in order to test your code on a
  :ref:`simulated robot <choregraphe-reference-simulated-robot>`.

Monitoring NAOqi on the robot
------------------------------


NAOqi automatic startup
+++++++++++++++++++++++

NAOqi is automatically launched in startup.

The script ``/etc/init.d/naoqi`` manages NAOqi's start:

* light up the eyes

* run NAOqi

Restarting and stopping NAOqi
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

To restart NAOqi, execute on the robot: ::

    /etc/init.d/naoqi restart

To stop NAOqi, execute on the robot: ::

    /etc/init.d/naoqi stop

.. note::
   There are also aliases corresponding to the above scripts: ``nao stop``, ``nao start``,
   ``nao restart`` and ``nao status``.

   You can also restart and stop NAOqi from the robot's web page.


Loading a module at startup
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

This section assumes that the module has been successfully cross-compiled and
copied on the robot.

If you want to use a module which is not loaded by default in NAOqi, you will
have to make it load at the beginning of naoqi. To do so, you must modify the
autoload.ini file.

The /home/nao/naoqi/preferences/autoload.ini file contains all libraries to
launch when NAOqi start.


* [user] contains all user libraries. You MUST put the full path to your library.

Example:
::

  [user]
  the/full/path/to/your/liblibraryname.so   # load liblibraryname.so


If your custom module requires other librairies, first make sure that they
are properly cross-compiled and copied to the robot. Then, to allow naoqi
to find these librairies, you must set LD_LIBRARY_PATH to the path of these
current librairies (typically /home/nao/naoqi/lib/): ::

  export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/full/path/to/your/libs

Then run naoqi as usual.

Logs
----

NAOqi logs from the console
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++

By default, if you are logged via ssh on the robot, no NAOqi log shows. There
are two ways to visualize the logs:

* by using logview, and
* by launching NAOqi in verbose mode from the console.

**To use logview**:

Type the command logview on the console, and give it the IP where you want to see
the logs (127.0.0.1 for example if you are already on the robot).

**To launch naoqi from the console in debug mode**:

Run the following command line from /home/nao/:

::

  naoqi -d


This command line is blocking.

.. warning::

   NAOqi is running on this console: if you interrupt it, you also kill NAOqi, so
   be particularly careful if you do so to prevent the robot from falling abruptly.


The logs will typically start like this:
::

  [INFO ] ..::: starting NAOqi version 1.12 :::..
  [INFO ] Copyright (c) 2011, Aldebaran Robotics
  [INFO ] Starting ALNetwork
  [INFO ] NAOqi is listening on 0.0.0.0:9559
  [INFO ] Loading "/etc/naoqi/autoload.ini"


Then the list of starting modules will appear. NAOqi startup is complete when
the following log shows:

::

  [INFO ] NAOqi is ready...




NAOqi logs from Choregraphe
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++

It is also possible to view NAOqi logs from Choregraphe. To do so, check the
"view all logs" box at the bottom left of the log console. From that moment,
both Choregraphe and NAOqi logs will appear.
