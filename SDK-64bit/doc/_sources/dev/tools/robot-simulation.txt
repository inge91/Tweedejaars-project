What is a simulated robot
-------------------------

A simulated robot is a robot which has no existence in the real life. It allows
you to test your code before running it on a real robot.


There are several ways to get to a simulated robot:

**Choregraphe** included **NAOqi**     This robot is launched at Choregraphe startup and stopped at Choregraphe closure.
                              
                                       It has the same abilities of a real one but:
                                        
                                       * It is not subjected to the gravity and its torso is always considered as in a straight position
                                         (exactly as it is displayed in the :ref:`3D view <3d-nao-panel>`).
                                         So it cannot fall and cannot be lied down.
                                       
                                       * Its joints are always considered as stiffened and the stiffness can never be set off.
                                       
                                       * It has no audition functions (speech recognition, recording, etc).
                                       
                                       * It has no audio player functions.
                                       
                                       * It has no LED.
                                       
                                       * You cannot directly interact with it (tactile touch, bumper, etc) but moving 
                                         a joint in :ref:`the 3D view <3d-nao-panel>`.
                                          
                                       This simulated robot is dependent of Choregraphe and is not accessible from other applications 
                                       such as **Monitor**.
                                         
**NAOqi binary**                       This robot has the same abilities as the previous one but is totally independent of 
                                       **Choregraphe**.
                                       
                                       So it can be connected from any other application (**Monitor** for example)
                                       and can be launched and exited as you wish independently from **Choregraphe**.
                                       
**NAOsim**                             **NAOsim** offers a robot simulation in a customizable virtual world.
                                       
                                       For further details about the abilities of this simulated robot see :ref:`NAOsim`.
