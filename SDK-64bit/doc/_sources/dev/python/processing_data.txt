Logging data - Head angles
==========================

Recording the values of various sensors of the robot is easy.

Here is a simple example:

:download:`data_recording.py </examples/python/data_recording.py>`

.. literalinclude:: /examples/python/data_recording.py
   :language: py


We simply have to call :cpp:func:`ALMemoryProxy::getData` every 50 ms, store the
values in a matrix, and then write the matrix to a file.


.. warning::
   This method is fairly slow. Do not try to get data at a higher frequency, it
   may take too much CPU on the robot.


.. todo:: Add link to ALMemory fastaccess?
