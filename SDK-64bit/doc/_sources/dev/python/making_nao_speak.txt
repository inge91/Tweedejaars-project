Using the API - Making NAO speak
================================

Making NAO speak
----------------

.. code-block:: python

  from naoqi import ALProxy
  tts = ALProxy("ALTextToSpeech", "<IP of your robot>", 9559)
  tts.say("Hello, world!")


Using a proxy
-------------

``ALProxy`` is an object that gives you acces to all the methods or the module your
are going to connect to.

.. py:class:: ALProxy(name, ip, port)

  * name - The name of the module
  * ip   - The IP of your robot
  * port - The port on which NAOqi listens (9559 by default)

  Every method of the module are directly accessible through the object, for
  instance::

    almemory = ALProxy("ALMemory", "nao.local", 9559)
    pings = almemory.ping()
