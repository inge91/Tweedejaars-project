Running Python code on the robot
================================


Here we will try to have the script found in the :ref:`python-reacting-to-events`
tutorial running automatically at naoqi startup.

Upload the script on the robot, for instance to ``/home/nao/reacting_to_events.py``,
then edit the ``/home/nao/naoqi/preferences/autoload.ini`` file to have:

.. code-block:: ini

   [python]
   /home/nao/reacting_to_events.py



Note that the `--pip` and `--pport` option are automatically set by
NAOqi while it runs the script.
