.. _python-sdk-troubleshooting:

Troubleshooting
---------------

Here are a few error message you could get, and a possible solution.

..
  FIXME: make sure to use the real error messages!


Import error
++++++++++++


::

  ImportError: No module named naoqi


You must have something wrong with your ``PYTHONPATH`` environnement variable.
You can check this by typing:

.. code-block:: python

   import sys
   print "\n".join(sys.path)


You should see `/path/to/python-sdk` at the beginning of the list.

::

  ImportError: ./_inaoqi.so: wrong ELF class: ELFCLASS32

You are using a 64 bits version of python.


::

  ImportError: libpython2.6.so.1.0: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory

You are using a Python2.7 with the python2.6 version of the Python SDK.


Version mismatch
++++++++++++++++


::

  Version mismatch


Your version of Python does not match the one with which the Python SDK was made.

Mac

Make sure ``VERSIONER_PYTHON_PREFER_32_BITS`` is **not** set.
(While 1.10 needed this parameter ON, release 1.12 needs this parameter to be OFF)


Errors with ALProxy
++++++++++++++++++++


.. code-block:: pytb

  RuntimeError: 	ALBrokerProxy::getBrokerInfo
      can not get broker info. Endpoint : http://nao.local:9559


Make sure NAOqi is running and the IP you used in :py:class:`ALProxy` constructor is correct


.. code-block:: pytb

  RuntimeError: 	ALNetwork::getModuleByName
      failed to get module MyModule http://nao.local:9559


Make sure you spelt the name of the module correctly.


.. code-block:: pytb

  File "naoqi.py", line 246, in method_missing
      raise e
  RuntimeError: 	ALTextToSpeech::sa
          ALBroker::methodCall: method: sa, params: ["hello"]
          ALTextToSpeech::sa
  Function sa does not exist in module ALTextToSpeech

Make sure you spelt the name of the function correctly.

To check the complete list of modules and method names,
see section :ref:`naoqi-api`

Weird float errors
++++++++++++++++++


If you notice that floats are trucated when they are the result of
the call of a bound methods, make sure that your locale is in english.

You can set LC_NUMERIC='C' for this

.. code-block:: python

   import locale
   locale.setlocale('LC_NUMERIC', 'C')
