Writing code for NAO
--------------------

The NAOqi API is currently available in at least 8 languages. Apart from some minor
language-specific differences, the API is mostly the same across all languages,
allowing you to bring knowledge from one language to another.

You can only write NAOqi's module in C++ and Python, but you have access
to the full client API in all languages.
Only C++ and Python are supported on the robot, other languages are only supported
on computer to remotely access NAO.

Jump to the :ref:`sdk-index` homepage.

Language supported on the robot:

- :ref:`C++<cpp-introduction>`  (to be used with `qiBuild <../qibuild/index.html>`_)
- :ref:`Python <python-introduction>`

Others supported languages:

- :ref:`.Net <naoqi-dot-net>`
- :ref:`Java <java>`
- :ref:`Matlab <matlab>`
- :ref:`Urbi <urbi>`
