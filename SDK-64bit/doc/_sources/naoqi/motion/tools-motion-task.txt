------------


What it does
------------

In **ALMotion**, every time you call an API to request a motion, a
"motion task" is created to handle the job. At each ALMotion cycle, the task
will compute the elementary commands (changes in motor angles and stiffnesses)
to perform the motion.

Examples of motion tasks include the walk, the fall manager, the joint-space
interpolator.


How it works
------------

Several motion tasks can coexist. For instance, a task may handle the walk
while another controls the arms motion.
To prevent several concurrent tasks from sending inconsitent motion commands
to the same motors, the tasks are required to declare and book the resources
they will control, such as a motor angle or stiffness.

If some resources needed for its execution are unavailable, the task manager
will refuse to start a task. It is however possible to free the resources by
killing the tasks that are using them.

.. note::

   The resources mentioned here are for ALMotion use only and are different
   from the ones :ref:`that are used in Choregraphe
   <choregraphe-reference-box-resource>` and managed by
   :ref:`alresourcemanager`.

Use Cases
---------

Case 1: Resource inavailable: tasks get postponed
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

In the following example, two motions tasks attempt to control the same joint.
As the corresponding resource is owned by the first task, the second one is
postponed until the resource is freed.

Case 2: Moving a joint without delay
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

In this example, motions are required using the ``setAngles`` method, which
does not lock the resource. The target can be changed without delay.
