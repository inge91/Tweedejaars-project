------------


What it does
------------

ALModule can be used as a base class for user modules to
help serve and advertise their methods.

How it works
------------

Each module advertises the methods that it wishes to make available
to clients participating in the network to a broker within the
same process.

The broker then transparently handles directory services so that clients
need not know if the module that provides a service is in the
same process, on the same machine, or on the same tcp network.

Within the same process, direct method calls are used to
provide optimal speed without having to change your method
signatures.


Performances and Limitations
----------------------------

Clients exist in a growing number of languages including c++,
Python, .Net, Java and Matlab.

Getting started
---------------

To create a new module, see in the programming guide :ref:`cpp-introduction` or :ref:`python-introduction` 
introductions, and more specifically:

* for C++: :ref:`cpp-create-module`.
* for Python: :ref:`python-reacting-to-events`.
