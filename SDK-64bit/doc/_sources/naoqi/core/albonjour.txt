:ref:`naoqi-core` || Overview | :ref:`API <albonjour-api>`

------------

What it does
------------

Advertises the NAOqi service on the local network using the bonjour protocol. 

.. note:: 
	
	Users will not need to call any methods of this module. 

| See the Apple developer documentation for further details about the protocol: 
| https://developer.apple.com/opensource/

How it works
------------

When NAO boots, NAO advertises his presence on the network at the system level. 
This is enough for him to be seen in Choregraphe's NAO browser.

The ALBonjour service provides the extra information that NAOqi is running.
