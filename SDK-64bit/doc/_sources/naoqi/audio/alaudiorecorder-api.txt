ALAudioRecorder API
===================

:ref:`naoqi-audio` || :ref:`Overview <alaudiorecorder>` | API

-----------------

.. seealso::

   - :ref:`Microphones Hardware <hardware-audio-in>`


Namespace : **AL**

.. code-block:: cpp

  #include <alproxies/alaudiorecorderproxy.h>


Method list
-----------

As any module, this module inherits methods from :ref:`almodule-api`.
It also has the following specific methods:

.. cpp:class:: ALAudioRecorderProxy

* :cpp:func:`ALAudioRecorderProxy::startMicrophonesRecording`
* :cpp:func:`ALAudioRecorderProxy::stopMicrophonesRecording`


Methods
-------

.. cpp:function:: void ALAudioRecorderProxy::startMicrophonesRecording(const std::string& filename, const std::string& type, const int& samplerate, const AL::ALValue& channels)

  This method launches the recording of the audio signal measured by the microphones formated as specified. The resulting recording is written in the specified file.

  Note that these recording capabilities are currently limited to the following formats:

  - four channels 48000Hz in OGG.
  - four channels 48000Hz in WAV uncompressed.
  - one channels (front, rear, left or right), 16000Hz, in OGG.
  - one channels (front, rear, left or right), 16000Hz, in WAV.

  :param filename: Absolute Path of the file

  :param type: "wav" or "ogg"

  :param samplerate: Requested sample rate

  :param channels: Requested channels


  .. literalinclude:: /samples/cpp/alaudiorecorder/alaudiorecorder_startrecording.cpp
     :language: cpp



.. cpp:function:: void ALAudioRecorderProxy::stopMicrophonesRecording()

  This method stops the recording of the signal collected by the microphones started
  with :cpp:func:`ALAudioRecorderProxy::startMicrophonesRecording`.
