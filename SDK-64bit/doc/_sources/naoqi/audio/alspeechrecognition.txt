What it does
------------

The **ALSpeechRecognition** module gives to the robot the ability to recognize
predefined words or phrases in several languages (english is the default language).

.. note::

   This module is only available on the robot.

How it works
------------

Technology
++++++++++

**ALSpeechRecognition** relies on sophisticated speech recognition technologies provided
by:

* ACAPELA GROUP for NAO Version 3.x and 

* NUANCE for NAO Version 4.

Operating principle
+++++++++++++++++++++

* Before starting, **ALSpeechRecognition** needs to be fed by the list of phrases that
  should be recognized.

* Once started, **ALSpeechRecognition** places in the key ``SpeechDetected``,
  a boolean that specifies if a speaker is currently heard or not.

* If a speaker is heard, the element of the list that best match what is heard by NAO is
  placed in the key ``WordRecognized``.

The ``WordRecognized`` key is organised as follows:

.. code-block:: guess

     [phrase_1, confidence_1, phrase_2, confidence_2, phrase_3, confidence_3, ..., phrase_n, confidence_n]

where:

*  **phrase_i** is one of the predefined phrases and 

* **confidence_i** an estimate of the probability that this phrase is indeed what
  has been pronounced by NAO's interlocutor.

Note that the different hypothesis contained in that key are ordered so that the
most likely phrases comes first.




Getting started
---------------

The easiest way to get started with **ALSpeechRecognition** is to use the
**Speech Reco** Choregraphe box.
