What it does
------------

The **ALTextToSpeech** module allows the robot to speak. It sends commands to a
text-to-speech engine, and authorizes also voice customization.
The result of the synthesis is sent to NAO's loudspeakers.


How it works
------------

**ALTextToSpeech** is based on a speech synthesizer provided by:

* **ACAPELA** for European languages, Chinese & Korean, and 
* **HTS Engine** for Japanese.

Depending on the engine, effects voice customization are possible.

For **ACAPELA** engine, voice can be customized through "tags" included within the
string command sent to the engine.
Further informations can be found here: :download:`Acapela Mobility Text TAGS Documentation</medias/dev/modules/audio/audio_system_acapelamobilitytexttags.pdf>`

The output audio stream of both engine can also be modified by using one of these effects:

- **pitch shifting** effect modifies the initial pitch of the voice,
- **double voice** effect produces a "delay/echo" effect on the main voice.

Further information can be found here : :cpp:func:`ALTextToSpeechProxy::setParameter`


.. note::

   **ACAPELA** and **HTS** engines are only available on the robot.


Getting Started
---------------

The easiest way to get started with *ALTextToSpeech* is to use the **Say** Choregraphe box.
