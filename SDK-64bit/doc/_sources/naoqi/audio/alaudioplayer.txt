What it does
------------

**ALAudioPlayer** provides playback services for multiple audio file format and
the associated common functionnalities (play, pause, stop, loop, etc...). The resulting
audio stream is in all cases sent to NAO's loudspeakers.

.. note::

   This module is only available on the robot.

How it works
------------

**ALAudioPlayer** relies on several decoding linux libraries (mainly Gstreamer and SNDFile) to efficiently
decode and stream to audio outputs a good variety of audio file formats.

Performances and Limitations
----------------------------

Efficiency has been optimized to reach the lowest time of reaction when loading / starting a
file but depending on the audio file format, that time can vary. For applications
that requires very low loading / starting times, uncompressed WAV files should be prefered
to any other compressed file format.


Getting started
---------------

The most straightforward way to start using **ALAudioPlayer** is to use the **Play Sound** box in Choregraphe (Audio boxes section).
