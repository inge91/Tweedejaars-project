This section describes the audio software components
of your robot.

NAOqi currently contains the following audio modules:

- :ref:`ALAudioDevice <alaudiodevice>`: manages audio inputs and outputs.

- :ref:`ALAudioPlayer <alaudioplayer>`: allows playing audio files on NAO.

- :ref:`ALAudioRecorder <alaudiorecorder>`: allows recording audio files on NAO.

- :ref:`ALTextToSpeech <altexttospeech>`:  allows NAO to speak.

- :ref:`ALSpeechRecognition <alspeechrecognition>`: allows NAO to understand
  what we say.

- :ref:`ALSoundDetection <alsounddetection>`: allows detecting sound
  events.

- :ref:`ALAudioSourceLocalization <alaudiosourcelocalization>`:
  allows localizing sounds detected by the ALSoundDetection module.

These modules are interdependent and organized as described in the figure below:
