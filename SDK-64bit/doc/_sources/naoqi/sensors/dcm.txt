New architecture
----------------

Since release 1.12, the DCM (Device Communication Manager) has been rewritten.

It is now separated in two part:

* the HAL (Hardware Abstract Layer) daemon, handles the hardware,
* the DCM NAOqi module, connects the HAL and NAOqi.

The API for the DCM HAL is the same as the API for the DCM.
