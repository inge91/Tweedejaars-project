What is the DCM
----------------

DCM stands for "Device Communication Manager".

The DCM is the NAO software module, part of the NAOqi system, that
is in charge of the communication with all electronic devices in the
robot (boards, sensors, actuators...) except the sound (in or out) 
and the camera. It manages the main communication line: 
the USB link with the ChestBoard. But there is also an I2C link
with devices in the robot head. Thus, the DCM is the link between the
"upper level" software (others modules) and the "lower level" software
(soft in electronic boards). Modules like "Motion" and "LEDs" directly
send commands to actuators using the DCM, while extractors and other
modules use sensor results returned by the DCM in ALMemory.

.. warning::

   Although the DCM itself and electronic boards have many
   securities, it is possible to damage the robot with bad configuration
   parameters or inappropriate series of actuator commands. Using
   directly the DCM means that you know what you are doing. First of all,
   read this documentation carefully.

Architecture overview
---------------------

As the DCM is a link between the high and low level, understanding
both high level architecture (NAOqi) and low level (devices/electronic
board) is useful to understand the DCM.

Like other modules, the DCM is part of the NAOqi environment. It is linked as a library.

Installation
------------

The DCM installation is done with the NAOqi installation. The DCM
is a library of the NAOqi core program.

At first, the DCM reads two preference files: the device.xml (with
all data about devices and subDevices) and the dcm.xml (with DCM
specific information).

.. warning::

   Even if it's possible to run the DCM as a remote object with
   Soap communication, it'll be very CPU consuming to do that, as the
   link between ALMemory and the DCM is highly used.

How the DCM handles various NAO models and versions
---------------------------------------------------

The DCM deals with many different NAO versions (V3+, V3.2, V3.3, V4) and models (T2, T14, H21, H25)

In the DCM, all the options managed are present by default (hands, arms, legs ...).
When a robot do not have some parts:

- DCM sends back 0 for the missing sensors,

- actuator changes do not have effect,

- eletronics boards won't answered to request.

To determine the body type and version of your robot, see the section :ref:`hardware-product-range`.
