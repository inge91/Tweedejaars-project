ALRobotPose API
===============

:ref:`naoqi-sensors` || :ref:`Overview <alrobotpose>` | API

------------


Namespace : **AL**

.. code-block:: cpp

  #include <alproxies/alrobotposeproxy.h>


Method list
-----------

As any module, this module inherits methods from :ref:`almodule-api`.
It also has the following specific methods:

.. cpp:class:: ALRobotPoseProxy

* :cpp:func:`ALRobotPoseProxy::getActualPoseAndTime`
* :cpp:func:`ALRobotPoseProxy::getPoseNames`


Event list
----------

* :naoqi:event:`robotPoseChanged`


ALMemory Keys list
------------------

* :naoqi:memkey:`robotPose`
* :naoqi:memkey:`robotPoseSince`



Methods
-------

.. cpp:function:: AL::ALValue ALRobotPoseProxy::getActualPoseAndTime()

  Get the actual robot posture and the time since it was detected.

  :return: ALValue array of size 2.
           The first element is a string whose value is the posture name.
           The second element is a float corresponding to the time in seconds elapsed
           since the posture was detected.

.. cpp:function:: AL::ALValue ALRobotPoseProxy::getPoseNames()

  Get the list of all postures names possibly returned by this module.

  :return: ALValue array of strings containing all the possible postures names.


Events
------

.. naoqi:event:: robotPoseChanged(std::string postureName)

  raised when the posture changes and the new posture has been
  constant for 500 ms. The corresponding ALMemory Key is `robotPoseChanged`,
  which is a string whose value is the current posture name.

  :param postureName: current posture name

ALMemory Keys
-------------

.. naoqi:memkey:: float robotPose

  A float (integer cast) coding the current posture (use :cpp:func:`ALRobotPoseProxy::getPoseNames`
  to match to the posture name)

.. naoqi:memkey:: float robotPoseSince

  A float corresponding to the time in seconds elapsed since the current posture was detected.
