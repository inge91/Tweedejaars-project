   - :ref:`Sonars Hardware <hardware-sonar>`

What it does
------------

**ALsonar** module retrieves ultrasonic sensor value from  :ref:`ALMemory <almemory>`,
process it and raises events according to the situation.

How it works
------------

In order to save battety power, ultrasonic sensors are not activated by default.

There are 4 different ultrasonic events: ``SonarLeftDetected``, ``SonarRightDetected``,
``SonarLeftNothingDetected``, ``SonarRightNothingDetected``.

   * - Case
     - Raised event
     - Description
   * - .. image:: /medias/naoqi/sonar_front_left.png
     - ``SonarLeftDetected``
     - There is someting in front of NAO (left side) at less
       than 0.5m. This means that NAO can't go forward and has to stop and turn right
       to avoid the obstacle.
   * - .. image:: /medias/naoqi/sonar_front_right.png
     - ``SonarRightDetected``
     - There is someting in front of NAO (right side) at less
       than 0.5m. This means that NAO can't go forward and has to stop and turn left
       to avoid the obstacle.
   * - .. image:: /medias/naoqi/sonar_right.png
     - ``SonarLeftNothingDetected``
     - There is nothing in front of NAO nor on his left side,
       this means NAO can go forward or turn left. An obstacle is present on the right
       side at less than 0.5m but it is not a problem if NAO goes forward.
   * - .. image:: /medias/naoqi/sonar_left.png
     - ``SonarRightNothingDetected``
     - There is nothing in front of NAO nor on his right side,
       this means NAO can go forward or turn left. An obstacle is present on the left
       side at less than 0.5m but it is not a problem if NAO goes forward.
   * - .. image:: /medias/naoqi/sonar_front_none.png
     - ``SonarLeftNothingDetected`` and ``SonarRightNothingDetected``
     - There is no obstacle, both ``SonarLeftNothingDetected`` and
       ``SonarRightNothingDetected`` are raised at the same time.

.. note::

   If you want to perform your own detection with sonars you can also retreive
   ultrasonic sensor values from ALMemory (find corresponding keys in
   :ref:`sonar-key`).
   If you are not familiar with this consult getData function of :ref:`almemory-api`.

Performance and Limitations
----------------------------

The obstacle detection threshold is 0.5m (it is a software threshold).
Detected obstacles are seen only if the distance is less than this threshold.

Only one sonar event is raised at the same time. This is because at a given time
we use both left and right ultrasonic sensor data, to determine in which
situation we are so as to raise the corresponding event.

Getting started
---------------

**Starting ultrasonic hardware**

Ultrasonic sensor hardware is not started by default. To start it,
subscribe to ALSonar module (:cpp:func:`ALSonarProxy::subscribe`).
Doing so starts the ultrasonic sensor hardware automatically.

**Checking the hardware**

To check that your ultrasonic sensor works properly you can start
Choregraphe and launch a Sonar box. First ensure that you are connected to your
real NAO hardware. Then drag and drop a sonar box in your diagram and run the
behavior.

**Observing the signal**

When a Sonar box is launched, you can watch the signal of the ultrasonic
sensor with Monitor.

**Stopping ultrasonic hardware**

To stop it, unsubscribe from the ALSonar module (:cpp:func:`ALSonarProxy::unsubscribe`).
If there are multiple subscribers, the ultrasonic sensor hardware will remain
active as long as remains at least one subscriber.

Use Cases
---------

You can use ultrasonic sensor to perform obstacle detection.

FAQ
---

**How can I start and stop my ultrasonic senors**

Please see :ref:`alsonar-getting-started` section.

**When connected to choregraphe, sonar box returns only left or nothing**

Check that you are connected to your real **NAO** and not to the local **NAOqi**
provided by **Choregraphe**.
