What it does
------------

This module generates the event :naoqi:event:`footContactChanged` whenever
the foot contact changes.

- If NAO has at least one foot on the ground, the event is raised with the value ``True``
- If NAO has no feeet on the ground, the event is raised with the value ``False``

The module also generates other values in :ref:`ALMemory <almemory>`:

- :naoqi:memkey:`footContact` (1.0f if one foot touched the ground)
- :naoqi:memkey:`leftFootContact` (1.0f if the left foot touched the ground)
- :naoqi:memkey:`rightFootContact` (1.0f if the right foot touched the ground)
- :naoqi:memkey:`leftFootTotalWeight` (the total weight on the left foot in Kg)
- :naoqi:memkey:`rightFootTotalWeight` (the total weight on the right foot in Kg)


How it works
------------

NAO has four :ref:`hardware-fsr` under each foot.

The aim of these sensors is to determine whether NAO's feet are touching
the ground or not. This information is used during the walk, where at least
one foot must maintain contact with the ground while walking, otherwise the
walk is stopped.

For more detials, see :ref:`motion-kill-walk-when-lifted` section.


Methods
-------

There are no public methods. The module automatically generates the events and values.
