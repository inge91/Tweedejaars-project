Overview
---------  

**NAO** comes with:

* :ref:`embedded-software`, running on the motherboard located in the head of NAO, allowing
  autonomous behaviors.
* :ref:`desktop-software`, running on your computer, allowing creation of new behaviors,
  remote control and simulations.

There are also :ref:`programmer-tools`, allowing remote control of the robot and
the expansion of its capabilities.

| **OpenNAO** is an embedded GNU/Linux distribution based on Gentoo, specifically developed to fit the **NAO** robot needs.
| For the basics see :ref:`upgrading-opennao`, to learn more see :ref:`opennao-advanced`.

**Choregraphe** is a visual programming language. It allows you to create animations
and behaviors for your NAO, test them on a simulated robot before trying them with
your real NAO, and also monitor and control NAO.
For a quick description, see :ref:`choregraphe-overview`, to learn and use it, see :ref:`choregraphe`.

**Monitor** is dedicated to give you an elementary feedback from your robot and
a simple access to its camera settings.
For further information, see :ref:`monitor`.

**NAOsim** is a simulator where you can test NAO  behaviors and your
algorithms in a virtual world. You can modify the environment by inserting and
modifying objects of various shapes.
For further information, see :ref:`NAOsim`.

| Copies of **NAOqi** can also run on your computer in order to let you test your behaviors on virtual robots.
| For further information, see :ref:`choregraphe-reference-simulated-robot`.

**Getting started**

To install desktop software, see :ref:`desktop-index` and :ref:`desktop-installation`.

.. _programmer-tools:

Tools for programmers
+++++++++++++++++++++++

Create your own code, using:

* **Choregraphe** as a visual programming language and/or,
* one of the available **SDKs**.

Depending on the chosen language, SDKs allows you to:

* create code to enrich **Choregraphe box library** (Python),
* create a code remotely controlling the robot (all SDKs),
* create new **NAOqi modules** and upload them on the robot (C++, Python).
