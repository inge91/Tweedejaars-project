Behavior manager panel
======================

What is the Behavior manager panel
-----------------------------------

The **Behavior manager** panel enables you to install, uninstall, play and stop
:ref:`behaviors<choregraphe-reference-behavior>` on the robot you are connected to.

The table below describes the main parts of the **Behavior manager panel**:

=====  =================   ================================================================================
Part    Name                Allows you to ...                          
=====  =================   ================================================================================
**A**   **Toolbar**         Manage the list of the Behaviors installed on the robot.

**B**   **Behaviors**       Know which behaviors are currently installed on the robot.

**C**   **Execution**       Control the execution of each installed Behavior.

**D**   **Default**         Select the behaviors to play automatically at NAO startup.
=====  =================   ================================================================================



.. note::
  1. You may have noticed that a behavior named **animation mode** is already
     installed on real robots which software version is equal to or higher than 1.12.
     It is a **read-only** behavior that you cannot delete or replace as it is a
     functionality needed by Choregraphe.
     
     For further information about this behavior, see :ref:`choregraphe-howto-use-animation-mode`.
     
  2. When you play a behavior (or a project) with the |play-button| **Play** button
     of Choregraphe, it is **temporary** installed and immediately executed.
     It does not appear in the list of installed behaviors.

Setting default behaviors
++++++++++++++++++++++++++

A default behavior is a behavior which is automatically played at NAO startup.

The checkbox column enables you to set a behavior as default.

.. list-table::
   :widths: 10 100
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Button
     - Function

   * - .. image:: /medias/desktop/choregraphe/behavior_manager_default_not_checked.png
     - Not checked: the behavior is not set as default.
   * - .. image:: /medias/desktop/choregraphe/behavior_manager_default_checked.png
     - Checked: the behavior is set as default.
       It will then be automatically executed at NAO startup.

.. note::
  You can also name a behavior **.default** to set it automatically as default behavior.

.. warning::
  You can play and set as default several behaviors simultaneously.
  But the behaviors needs to be compatible.
  For example a behavior making NAO sit down and another making him walk are not compatible.
  Please set the :ref:`resources <choregraphe-reference-box-resource>` of your boxes to avoid conflicts between simultaneous behaviors (see :ref:`How to set resources of a box <choregraphe-howto-set-resources-for-box>`).
