What is the Video monitor panel 
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


The **Video monitor** panel:

* displays what is seen by the active camera of NAO's head. It shows you in
  real-time what NAO is seeing.

* It also allows you to teach NAO to recognize objects.

**Limitations**: the video monitor can only retrieve images from a real NAO or
a simulated robot  from :ref:`NAOsim<naosim>`.

       For more information, see section: :ref:`Teaching NAO to recognize objects <choregraphe-tuto-learn-object>`.
   * - .. image:: /medias/desktop/choregraphe/video_monitor_import.png
     - **Import** a vision recognition database from your computer to Choregraphe.
   * - .. image:: /medias/desktop/choregraphe/video_monitor_export.png
     - **Export** Choregraphe's current vision recognition database to save it on your computer.

       .. note::
          A vision recognition database is saved as a **.vrd** file.
   * - .. image:: /medias/desktop/choregraphe/video_monitor_new.png
     - **Clear** Choregraphe's current vision recognition database.

       This action removes any object you already taught from Choregraphe's current vision recognition database.
       Choregraphe suggest you back up its current database before clearing it.
   * - .. image:: /medias/desktop/choregraphe/video_monitor_send.png
     - **Send** the current Choregraphe's vision recognition database to the connected NAO.

       .. warning::
          The vision recognition database currently on NAO will be replaced by Choregraphe's current one.

.. warning::
   The vision recognition database is **not saved in the project file**.
   So if your behavior needs your vision recognition database to work
   and you want to execute your behavior on another robot,
   you will then have to send your vision recognition database to that other robot first.

.. note::
   The vision recognition database is **not reinitialized** at Choregraphe closure or startup.
