                              * Choregraphe includes and opens by default a Box library named **default** 
                                which is read-only. It contains all the elementary boxes you need to create
                                your first behaviors. Those boxes are ordered by their category of action
                                (motion, LEDs, etc) or their function in the diagram (flow control,
                                templates of boxes, etc).
                                
                              * The **Search** Tab enables you to search a specific box among all the opened
                                box libraries.
                             
**B**   Selected **Box**      Each :ref:`choregraphe-reference-box` is represented with
                              its name and its image.
                             
**C**   **Tooltip**           Displays the description of the selected box.

How to use the Box library
---------------------------

You can drag and drop any of the boxes contained in a **Box library** onto the
:ref:`choregraphe-overview-flow-diagram-panel` to enrich
a :ref:`Behavior<choregraphe-reference-behavior>` or a :ref:`choregraphe-reference-box`.


How to customize the Box library
----------------------------------

You can **create** or **open** your own :ref:`Box library <choregraphe-reference-box-library>`
through the **Box library** menu.

It is then possible for you to customize your **Box library**:

* **Add a box** from the Flow diagram to your library by right-clicking on the
  box in the Flow diagram and select **Add to library**.
* **Copy** a box (or a folder) from an other box library by right-clicking on it
  and selecting **Copy**, then **paste** the box (or the folder) into yours by right-clicking in your box library and selecting **Paste**.
* **Edit** the name, the description and the image of a box contained in your box
  library by double-clicking on it in the box library panel or right-clicking and selecting **Box properties**.
* **Move** a box (or a folder) around.
* **Create a new folder** by right-clicking in your box library and selecting **Create Folder**.
* **Rename a folder** by double-clicking on it in the **Box library** panel or right-clicking and selecting **Rename**.

You can then **save** or **close** the opened box library by selecting it (**left-click
on the tab** corresponding to the concerned box library) and then going to the
**Box library** menu to select the action you want to make (save or close).

.. note::
   | You can also **save** or **open** a box library **as a directory**.
   | For further information, see :ref:`choregraphe-howto-open-save-directory`.

   Note also that the opened box libraries are automatically saved when you exit Choregraphe.

To automatically open your own box libraries at Choregraphe startup:

1. Choose **Edit** > **Preferences**.

2. Choose the box libraries you want to be opened in the field **User's box libraries**.

What is a Box library
---------------------

.. image:: /medias/desktop/choregraphe/boxlibrary_icon.png
   :width: 45 px
   :height: 44 px

A box library consists of a list of :ref:`Boxes <choregraphe-reference-box>`.

This list can be organized with **directories** in order to sort boxes by category for example.

Each box may have **attached files** (music, image, etc) also included in the box library.

A box library is particularly useful when you **often use** the same boxes.
You can store it in a box library and use and reuse it later.

| A box library is either a single compressed file (with a **CBL** extension) or a **directory**.
| For further details, see :ref:`choregraphe-howto-open-save-directory`.
|

.. note::
   In versions **older than 1.10**, box library files were not compressed (the extension was **XAL**).
