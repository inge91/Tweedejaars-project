Debug window
=============


What is the Debug window
-------------------------

The Debug window enables you to debug your behavior by displaying **messages** coming from running behaviors.

.. image:: /medias/desktop/choregraphe/chore_debug_window.png
   :width: 600 px
   :height: 281 px

Any message displayed includes:

* its :ref:`choregraphe-severity-level`,

* the :ref:`choregraphe-box-path` concerned by the message and 

* the **text** of the message.

You can:

* define which events are logged (see section :ref:`choregraphe-detailed-interface-debug-panel`),

* edit log list (see section :ref:`choregraphe-editing-log-list`).

.. _choregraphe-severity-level:

Severity level
---------------

Each message can have a different **level of severity** which are displayed with different **prefixes** and in different **colours**:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 10 10 100
   :header-rows: 1

   * - | Level of
       | Severity
     - Prefix
     - Description
   * - debug
     - .. image:: /medias/desktop/choregraphe/debug_panel_prefix_debug.png
     - This is generally used to debug a very specific point in the behavior.

       .. note::
          A message with a debug severity level also contains the corresponding **line number** in the box script which is in brackets and then the **name of the concerned method** in the box script.
   * - verbose
     - .. image:: /medias/desktop/choregraphe/debug_panel_prefix_verbose.png
     - These logs generally describe what is happening in the behavior step by step.
   * - info
     - .. image:: /medias/desktop/choregraphe/debug_panel_prefix_info.png
     - Generally these logs are not essential but can be useful for someone else who would use your behavior.
   * - warning
     - .. image:: /medias/desktop/choregraphe/debug_panel_prefix_warning.png
     - This is generally used to warn you about an important fact which does not threaten the smooth running of the behavior.
   * - error
     - .. image:: /medias/desktop/choregraphe/debug_panel_prefix_error.png
     - This is used for errors which does threaten the smooth running of the behavior.

       .. note::
          When an error is raised in a box, the specific box and all its :ref:`parents <choregraphe-reference-box-parent>` get red in order to find the cause of the problem more easily.
          For example below, we tried to change the speech recognition language of NAO to Chinese but we did not have Chinese installed on the robot:

          .. image:: /medias/desktop/choregraphe/chore_error_red_box.png
   * - fatal
     - .. image:: /medias/desktop/choregraphe/debug_panel_prefix_fatal.png
     - This is not very used but you can use it for example for errors which surely make the behavior crash.



.. _choregraphe-box-path:

Path of the box
----------------

The **path of the box** is contained in a string which looks like the following:

``ALFrameManager__<behavior-id>__<box-path>``

where:

* ``<behavior-id>`` corresponds to the identification number of the behavior (which enables you to determine which behavior does the message come from).

* ``<box-path>`` corresponds to the path of the box which the message comes from.

  For example a box named ``Child`` is in the diagram of a box named ``Parent``.
  ``Parent`` is in the main diagram.
  The path of ``Child`` should look like ``root__Parent_2__Child_4``.

  The numbers in the path enables to identify boxes that have the same name so that the path is unique for each box.

.. _choregraphe-detailed-interface-debug-panel:

Defining which events are logged
---------------------------------

By default, this panel displays only messages caused by **running behaviors** with **info** as a minimal level of severity.
But you can even get all messages from NAOqi and NAOqi's modules, and get messages from lower level of severity.

* To get **all messages** from NAOqi and NAOqi's modules: check the checkbox **Show all logs**.

* To adjust the **level of severity**: use **Log Level** drop-list.

For example, if **Error** is selected as Log Level, messages displayed in the panel will be only the ones defined as **fatal** or **error**.
In the same way, if **Debug** is selected, messages of any level will be displayed.

.. warning:: Selecting a very low level will result in having a lot of messages,
   possibly **reducing the speed** of the whole application.

.. note::
   You should know that you can send messages yourself **from the scripts of your own boxes**.
   For more information, see the section: :ref:`choregraphe-reference-box-script-built-in-functions`.


.. _choregraphe-editing-log-list:

Editing log list
----------------
   
If you right-click in the Debug window, the following menu is displayed:
