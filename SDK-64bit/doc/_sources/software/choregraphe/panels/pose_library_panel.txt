Pose library panel
===================

What is the Pose library panel
-------------------------------

The **Pose library** panel displays specific **Timeline** boxes containing NAO preset positions.

It enables you to easily define and access standard key positions for NAO when you create a behavior.

Choregraphe includes by default a **Pose library** which is automatically opened when you open the **Pose library** panel.
It contains some basic positions you could need to create your first animations.

Using Pose library panel
-------------------------

You can use this library to **add boxes to your behavior** by dragging and
dropping a position from the pose library to the flow diagram as you would do with the box library.
The resulting box enables you to put NAO directly in this position during your behavior.

.. warning::
   These poses are not like the **Stand Up** box you can find in the default box library for example.
   **NAO will not calculate the right animation to go to the position safely**.
   He will directly go to the position, whatever the initial position he currently is in.
   So make sure that your robot can go to it without falling before using a pose.

Clicking on a chosen position will automatically and **directly put NAO in the selected position**.

.. note::
   A robot first needs to have its joints **stiffened** to go to any position from the pose library,
   unless it is a simulated robot without any physics effect (the local NAOqi found in Choregraphe for example).
   For more information about the abilities of a simulated robot, see the definition of a :ref:`simulated robot <choregraphe-reference-simulated-robot>`.

Customizing Pose library panel
------------------------------- 

You can **add a folder** to organize the pose library as you wish by right-clicking anywhere on the **Pose library** panel and selecting **Create Folder**.

You can **edit** the name, the description and the image of a pose by right-clicking on it and selecting **Position properties**.
A new widget will be displayed where you will be able to enter a new **name**, a new **description** and/or choose a new **image** for the position.

You can **delete** a specific position by right-clicking on it and selecting **Delete**.

Here are the other actions you can make using the buttons of the toolbar of the **Pose library** panel:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 10 100
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Button
     - Function
   * - .. image:: /medias/desktop/choregraphe/chore_pose_library_open.png
     - **Open** an existing pose library from your computer.
   * - .. image:: /medias/desktop/choregraphe/chore_pose_library_export.png
     - **Export all** the opened libraries into a single one to your computer.
   * - .. image:: /medias/desktop/choregraphe/chore_pose_library_add.png
     - **Add NAO's current position** to the list of the poses in the **Pose library** panel.

       A new widget will be displayed to give a **name**, a **description** and an **image** to your new position.

       .. note::
          You can take a **screenshot** of the 3D view to illustrate the position.

Feel free to complete the default pose library with your own positions or to create your own pose library.

You should know that you can also choose to automatically open at Choregraphe startup your own pose libraries.
To do so, go to the menu **Edit** > **Preferences**.
Then choose the pose libraries you want to be opened in the field **User's pose libraries**.
