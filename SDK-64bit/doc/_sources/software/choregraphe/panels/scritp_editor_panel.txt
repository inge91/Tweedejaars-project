.. image:: /medias/desktop/choregraphe/script-editor-context-menu.png
   :width: 307 px
   :height: 261 px


This **context menu** provides fast access to some classic functions for a script editor:

* **Undo**: to revert last script modification.

* **Redo**: to apply previously reverted modification.

* **Cut**, **Copy**, **Paste** or **Delete**: to cut, copy, delete selected text block or paste text at the current location of editing cursor.

* **Select All**: to select the complete script.

* **Block comment or uncomment**: to toggle the current line or the selected text block commented or uncommented.

It also enables you to make some other advanced actions:

* **Insert Unicode control character**: to insert various characters.
  This menu is not always available depending on the OS. But anyway:

  .. warning::
     **It is strongly advised to not use this menu** as it inserts characters that are not visible in the script editor and that may lead to errors during the execution of the behavior.

* **Insert Function**: to insert a :ref:`built-in function <choregraphe-reference-box-script-built-in-functions>` only available from a box script.


Search functions
++++++++++++++++

You have useful functions at the bottom of the panel:

* **Search text field** to find a specific keyword in the current script:

  .. image:: /medias/desktop/choregraphe/chore_script_editor_find.png
     :width: 163 px
     :height: 30 px


  It is highlighted in red if the keyword is not found in the script:

  .. image:: /medias/desktop/choregraphe/chore_script_editor_find_red.png
     :width: 164 px
     :height: 26 px

  .. warning::
     The searching function **does not** permit to **loop**.
     The search text field will highlight in red if string specified isn't found after the current location of the editing cursor.
     In this case, keep in mind you can use the button |search-previous| to **search before** the location of the cursor.

* **Navigation buttons** to move to the previous or the next matching string:
