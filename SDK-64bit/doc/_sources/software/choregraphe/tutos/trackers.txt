Tracking a sound
----------------
In Choregraphe there is a very easy way to track a sound, using the **Trackers > Sound Tracker** box.

This box is made to track sound using NAO's head.

#. Drag and drop the Sound Tracker box onto your diagram.

#. Link the input of the box to the beginning of the root behavior.

   Your diagram should look like that:

   .. image:: /medias/desktop/choregraphe/sound_tracker.png

#. Start the behavior using the following play button in the tool bar:

   .. image:: /medias/desktop/choregraphe/beginning_play_button.png

NAO reacts to surrounding sounds by moving its head toward the sound direction.

You can modify the threshold, by clicking on the adjustable wrench in the bottom left corner.

This threshold decides if the location of the sound is correct or not.

To track a red ball with NAO's whole, we will use the **Trackers > WB Tracker** box.

This box is made to track a head or a red ball using NAO's whole body.

#. Drag and drop the WB Tracker box onto your diagram.

#. Click on the adjustable wrench in the bottom left corner of the box and set the target choice to **Red ball** and the time before lost(s) to 4 seconds.

#. Link the input of the box to the beginning of the root behavior.

   Your diagram should look like that:
