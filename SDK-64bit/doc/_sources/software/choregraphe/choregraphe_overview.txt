What is it
----------
**Choregraphe** is a multi-platform desktop application. 

It allows you to:

* Create animations and behaviors,
* Test them on a simulated robot, or directly on a real one,
* Monitor and control NAO.

**Choregraphe** allows you to create very complex behaviors (*e.g.* interaction with
people, dance, send e-mails, etc...), without writing a single line of code. 
In addition, it allows you to add your own Python code to a Choregraphe behavior.

Choregraphe and NAOqi
----------------------

What is its link to NAOqi
++++++++++++++++++++++++++
The behaviors created with **Choregraphe** are written in its specific graphical language.
 NAOqi (see :ref:`naoqi-overview`) NAO interprets them through and execute them.

Choregraphe also interacts with NAOqi to provide useful tools such as the
:ref:`video-monitor-panel`, the :ref:`choregraphe-overview-behavior-manager-panel`,
the :ref:`choregraphe-overview-toolbar`, the :ref:`3D-nao-panel` or the
:ref:`choregraphe-detailed-interface-timeline-editor`.

What can I do in Choregraphe that I cannot in NAOqi
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Choregraphe eases the interaction with NAOqi. With it you can quickly create
animations and programs for your NAO that would be way longer to do with NAOqi alone.

What can I do in NAOqi that I cannot in Choregraphe
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
You can access all the API of NAOqi via Choregraphe, therefore everything that
is possible in NAOqi is possible with Choregraphe.

On the other hand, behaviors programmed with the Choregraphe language are slower
at execution time than they would be if written in C++ (see :ref:`cpp-introduction`)
or Python (see :ref:`python-introduction`).
