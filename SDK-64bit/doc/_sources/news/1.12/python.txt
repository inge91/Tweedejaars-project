Python SDK changes
==================

The Python SDK is now disctinct from the C++ SDK.

.. warning:: You will still find naoqi.py, _inaoq.dll files inside the C++
   SDK, but those are used by the naoqi executable. Do NOT use them to
   write Python code outside Choregraphe.


On Windows the supported version is Python2.7.

On Mac, you can now choose between the Python from Apple, already present on
your OS, Python 2.6.1, or use Python2.7 from Python.org.

.. note:: 
   The Python SDK is now in 64bits, so you no longer need the
   VERSIONER_PYTHON_PREFER_32_BITS environment variable.


On Linux, Python 2.7 and Python 2.6 are now supported, allowing you
to use the Python SDK on the latest Ubuntu release as well as on the latest
LTS release.
