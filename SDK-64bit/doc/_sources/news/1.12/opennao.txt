OpenNAO Changes
===============

Persistent Settings
+++++++++++++++++++

System settings are now persistent. They will not be lost when the robot is updated.

This include:

- name
- password
- timezone
- volume
- network configuration


User accounts
+++++++++++++

Logging in as *root* over ssh is now disabled. However, the *su* command remains available.

The *root* password is *root*. We recommend to change the *nao*'s password using the web page.


NAOqi integration
+++++++++++++++++

NAOqi is no longer installed in ``/opt/naoqi``.
It is now packaged and installed like any others programs in ``/usr``.


For further information about the NAOqi, refer to: :ref:`NAOqi release note <naoqi>`.
