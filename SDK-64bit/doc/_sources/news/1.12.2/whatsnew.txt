.. _whats-new:

What's new - 1.12.2
=====================

NAO firmware
--------------

After a few weeks of life, NAO V4 needed to be settled, adjusted.

* **Thermal model** has been updated, in order to safely allow him to go further
  before saying "Motor hot".

* **Current limits** of the motors have been pushed forward, so NAO V4 should be
  strong enough for the most difficult poses.

* **Head Fan** temperature/speed settings have been also updated in order to
  minimize unnecessary noise.
  
* **WiFi** transmission from the robot highly improved.

So don't forget to update your robot: :ref:`choregraphe-howto-update-nao-system`.


Choregraphe
------------

Improved boxes
+++++++++++++++

**Walk to** and **Walk Toward** boxes take less time to stop:
in order to make NAO react more quickly, **Walk to** and **Walk Toward** boxes
now use **ALMotion stopWalk()** to stop.

**Stand up** box has been fixed, its behavior is again symmetric.

Installation on a multi user computer
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

License key activation on a multi user computer is now implemented for
**Choregraphe Suite**.

So before installing, make sure you are logged as Administrator.

For further details, see :ref:`desktop-installation`.

Temporary directories cleaning
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

In version 1.12.0 and previous ones, **Choregraphe** could have created temporary
directories in a wrong path where the Windows **Cleaning disk** command has not access.

This issue is now fixed.

To know how to clean manually these temporary files,
see :ref:`choregraphe-temporary-directories-fix`.



NAOsim
----------

Installation on a multi user computer
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

License key activation on a multi user computer is now implemented for **NAOsim**.

So before installing, make sure you are logged as Administrator.

For further details, see :ref:`desktop-installation-sim-installing`.



License activation for non connected computers
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

**NAOsim Activator** allows you to activate NAOsim License even if your computer
has no Internet connection.
