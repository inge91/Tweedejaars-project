----------------------


Aims
++++

This device is designed for advanced research such as SLAM (Simultaneous
Localization And Mapping).

It is not designed to support all NAO standard behaviors. Better use the standard
head for voice recognition or animations involving fall hazard.

Key data
+++++++++

- Wave length: 785nm.
- Resolution: 3 percent.
- Detection range: 0.2m - 5.6m.
- Angular range: 240Â°.


Offset of the laser plane
+++++++++++++++++++++++++

As shown on the diagram, z is equivalent to 106.6 mm between the
rotation center and the laser plane.

Safety
++++++

.. warning::

   A fall could damage the laser head.

Version 3.2 is not yet protected against damages occurring during a fall.
