NAOqi Python API
================

Some part of the Python SDK are used internally by choregraphe,
or generated automatically so please do not use anything that is not documented
here, or expect the API to change.


NAOqi
------


This is the main Python module.

ALProxy
+++++++++

The ``ALProxy`` object lets you create a proxy to a module.

Two different constructors are supported, depending whether
or not you have a Broker instance available.

**ALProxy(name, ip, port)**

* *name* is the name of the module,

* *ip*   is the IP of the broker in which the module is running,

* *port* is the port of the broker.

As a rule of thumb, you should use this when writing code outside choregraphe.


**ALProxy(name)**

* *name* is the name of the module.


ALBroker, ALModule
++++++++++++++++++

You should only need this if you want to write
NAOqi modules in Python, for instance because you
need to subsribe to an event with a callback.

The full process is a bit tricky, and is documented in
the :ref:`python-reacting-to-events` tutorial.

**ALBroker(name, ip, port, parent_ip, parent_port)**

Create a python broker.

* *name* name of the broker.

* *ip*   The IP the broker will be listening to.

* *port* The port the broker will be listening to. If the it equals ``0``, we will find a free port and use this.

* *parent_ip* The IP of an other broker to connect to.

* *parent_port* The port of an other broker to connect to.


**ALModule(name)**

This class lets you write NAOqi modules in Python.



almath
------


This is a Python wrapping of the :ref:`almath <libalmath-doc>` C++ library.
