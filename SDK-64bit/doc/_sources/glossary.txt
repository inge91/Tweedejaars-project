   Actuator

       Electronic device able to receive commands.

       In ALMemory, actuator values contain the last command sent to the actuator.


   Blocking Method

       Like normal method calls, simple calls are blocking - The next
       instruction will be executed after the end of the previous call. All calls can
       raise an exception and should be encapsulated in a try-catch block. Calls can
       have return values.

       Further details: :ref:`naoqi-blocking-non-blocking`.

   Body
       In ALMotion, Body is the group gathering all joints of the robot. 
	   
       Further details: :ref:`body-chain-def`. See also: :term:`Whole Body Motion`.


   Broker

       A broker is an executable and a server that can listen to remote commands
       on IP and port.

       Further details: :ref:`naoqi-broker`.

   Chain
       In ALMotion, a chain is a group of joints. 
	   
       Further details: :ref:`body-chain-def`.

   COM
       Center Of Mass.

   DOF
   Degrees of freedom
   
       Degrees of freedom (DOF) are the set of independent displacements and/or
       rotations that specify completely the displaced or deformed position and
       orientation of the body or system.
	   
       NAO degrees of freedom are listed in NAO Datasheet:
       
       - `NAO H25 <http://aldebaran-robotics.com/en/Discover-NAO/nao-datasheet-h25.html>`_
       - `NAO H21 <http://aldebaran-robotics.com/en/Discover-NAO/nao-datasheet-h21.html>`_
       - `NAO T14 <http://aldebaran-robotics.com/en/Discover-NAO/nao-datasheets-t14.html>`_
       - `NAO T2 <http://aldebaran-robotics.com/en/Discover-NAO/nao-datasheets-t2.html>`_.

       See also: :term:`joint`.
   
   DCM
   Device Communication Manager

       The DCM is the NAO software module, part of the NAOqi system, that
       is in charge of the communication with all electronic devices in the
       robot (boards, sensors, actuators...) except the sound (in or out)
       and the camera. It manages the main communication line:
       the USB link with the ChestBoard. But there is also an I2C link
       with devices in the robot head. Thus, the DCM is the link between the
       "upper level" software (others modules) and the "lower level" software
       (soft in electronic boards).

       Further details: :ref:`what-is-dcm`.


   Effector

       Effectors are points allowing to control position by Cartesian methods.
       There are 6 effectors: "Head" , "LArm", "LLeg", "RLeg", "RArm", "Torso".

       Further details: :ref:`control-cartesian`.

   Hardness

       Hardness (named as stiffness in the Motion module) of the joint. The
       value is from 0.0 to 1.0, 0 means 0% and 1 means 100% (full power).
       In the motorboard, this percentage is directly applied to the max
       current. Setting the hardness to 0.5 means that the electric current
       limitation is reduced to 50%.

       Further details: :ref:`jointHardness`. See also: :term:`stiffness`.

   Initial Pose
   NAO Initial position
   Pose Init
       Specific stable pose with: kneeAngle = 40.0 deg and torsoAngle = wideAngle = 0.0 deg.
       
       A good starting point for most of the motion animations. 
       
       Available in Choregraphe **Pose Library** 
       (see Choregraphe :ref:`choregraphe-overview-pose-library-panel`),
       or can be reached using ALMotion Joint control API
       (see :ref:`control-joint-tuto`).

       See also: :term:`Pose`.
       
   Irrecord

       The LIRC program used by the :ref:`ALInfrared` module to record IR
       (Infra Red) remote controls.

       See also: :term:`LIRC`.

   Joint

       Point of articulation, connection that allow motion.
       In ALMotion, all Degrees Of Freedom except hands are called joints.
	   
       Further details: :ref:`body-chain-def`. See also: :term:`DOF`.


   LIRC

       LIRC (Linux Infrared Remote Control).

   Non-blocking Method

       By using the *post* object of a proxy, a task is created
       in a parallel thread. This enables you to do other work at the same time (e.g.
       walking while talking). Each *post* call generates a *task id*.  You can
       use this *task id* to check if a task is running, or wait until the task is finished.

       See also: :term:`blocking method`.

       Further details: :ref:`naoqi-blocking-non-blocking`.

   Pose

       Combination of position and orientation of a body in a coordinate
       system.
       
       Useful poses are available in Choregraphe **Pose Library** 
       (see Choregraphe :ref:`choregraphe-overview-pose-library-panel`),
       or can be reached using ALMotion Joint control API
       (see :ref:`control-joint-tuto`).

       See also: :term:`Pose Init`.

   Position6D

       A Position6D is a vector of 6 dimensions composed of 3 translations
       (in meters) and 3 rotation (in radians).

       See also: :term:`Transform`.

       Further details: `libalmath Overview <ref/libalmath/overview.html>`_.


   Posture

       A configuration of the robot body, generally involving all joints.

       Further details: :ref:`alrobotpose`.

   SE3 Interpolation

       SE3 Interpolation is used for all interpolations that are defined in Cartesian Space.

       Further details: :ref:`motion-se3-interpolation`

	   
   Singularity

       A position in the robot's workspace where one or more joints no longer
       represent independent controlling variables.

       Mathematically, a Jacobian mathematical matrix formulation can be used to relate
       the motion in joint space to the motion in Cartesian space.
       The singularity occurs when the inverse Jacobian becomes singular (determinant = 0).

   Spaces

       ALMotion uses 3 different spatial references: :term:`SPACE_TORSO`,
       :term:`SPACE_WORLD` and :term:`SPACE_NAO`.

       Further details: :ref:`motion-effectors-space`.


   SPACE_NAO
   
       | One of the 3 spatial references used by ALMotion. 
       | This is average of the two feet positions projected around a vertical z axis.
         This space is useful, because the x axis is always forwards, so provides
         a natural ego-centric reference.
       |
	   
       Further details: :ref:`motion-effectors-space`.

   SPACE_TORSO

       | One of the 3 spatial references used by ALMotion. 
       | This is attached to NAO's torso reference, so moves with NAO as he walks
         and changes orientation as he leans. This space is useful when you have
         very local tasks, that make sense in the orientation of the torso frame.
       |
	   
       Further details: :ref:`motion-effectors-space`.

   SPACE_WORLD
   
       | One of the 3 spatial references used by ALMotion. 
       | This is a fixed origin that is never altered. It is left behind when NAO walks,
         and will be different in z rotation after NAO has turned. This space is useful
         for calculations which require an external, absolute frame of reference.
       |
	   
       Further details: :ref:`motion-effectors-space`.
	
   Stiffness

       The stiffness of the joint is equivalent to a torque limitation into
       the motors. If the joint stiffness is set to 0.0, the joint controller
       do nothing and the joint is free. Else with a value at 1.0 the joint is
       allowed to use full torque power to reach a given position.

       Further details: :ref:`Stiffness control <control-stiffness>`. See also: :term:`hardness`.

   Support polygon

       | For a rigid object in contact with a fixed environment and acted upon by gravity in
         the vertical direction, its support polygon is a horizontal region over which the center
         of mass must lie to achieve static stability.
       | For example, for an object resting on a horizontal surface (e.g. a table),
         the support polygon is the convex hull of its "footprint" on the table.
       |

   Transform

       Way to describe a solid in space. It is composed of a rotation matrix and a translation.

       See also: :term:`Position6D`.

       Further details: `libalmath Overview <ref/libalmath/overview.html>`_.



   Whole Body Motion

       Whole Body Motion is a Generalized Inverse Kinematics which deals with
       Cartesian and joint control, balance, redundancy and task priority.
