# This test demonstrates how to use the ALVisionRecognition module.
# Note that you might not have this module depending on your distribution.
#
# - We first instantiate a proxy to the ALVisionRecognition module
#     Note that this module should be loaded on the robot's NaoQi.
#     The module output its results in ALMemory in a variable
#     called "PictureRecognized".

# - We then read this AlMemory value and check whether we get
#   interesting things.
