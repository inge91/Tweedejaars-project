@article{Muller2011,
abstract = {Complex motions like kicking a ball into the goal are becoming more important in RoboCup leagues such as the Standard Platform League. Thus, there is a need for motion sequences that can be parameterized and changed dynamically. This paper presents a motion engine that translates motions into joint angles by using trajectories. These motions are defined as a set of Bezier curves that can be changed online to allow adjusting, for example, a kicking motion precisely to the actual position of the ball. During the execution, motions are stabilized by the combination of center of mass balancing and a gyro feedback-based closed-loop PID controller.},
